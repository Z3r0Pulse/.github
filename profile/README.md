# OpenQQuantify

OpenQ Quantify is an open‑source, AI‑powered Electronic Design Automation (EDA) & simulation platform that lets you design, prototype, and validate electronics faster than ever. By uniting Generative AI, machine learning, autonomous multi‑agent orchestration, and a cloud‑native, game‑engine digital twin, we accelerate every phase of the hardware lifecycle — from napkin concept ➜ mass‑production.
