# OpenQQuantify

OpenQ‚ÄØQuantify is an open‚Äësource, AI‚Äëpowered Electronic Design Automation (EDA) & simulation platform that lets you design, prototype, and validate electronics faster than ever. By uniting Generative AI, machine learning, autonomous multi‚Äëagent orchestration, and a cloud‚Äënative, game‚Äëengine digital twin, we accelerate every phase of the hardware lifecycle ‚Äî from napkin concept ‚ûú mass‚Äëproduction.
