OpenQâ€¯Quantify is an openâ€‘source, AIâ€‘powered Electronic Design Automation (EDA) & simulation platform that lets you design, prototype, and validate electronics faster than ever. By uniting Generative AI, machine learning, autonomous multiâ€‘agent orchestration, and a cloudâ€‘native, gameâ€‘engine digital twin, we accelerate every phase of the hardware lifecycle from concept to production.
